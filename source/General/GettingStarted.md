# Getting started with OSB

Welcome to Open Source Brain!

The first step is to choose between using {ref}`OSBv1 <v1:getting_started>` (as described in [Gleeson et al. 2019](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30444-1)) and {ref}`OSBv2 <osbv2>` (our new platform for **data** as well as model sharing, with support for NWB, NetPyNE and JupyterLab).

## Use OSBv1...

- If you want to explore the models described in [Gleeson et al. 2019](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30444-1)
- If you want to visualise, analyse and simulate NeuroML 2 models in your browser

See {ref}`here <v1:getting_started>` for more details.

## Use OSBv2...

- If you want to share neuroscience data in standardised formats
- If you want to use NetPyNE
- If you want to create and share Python based workflows

See {ref}`here <osbv2>` for more details.
