# Usage metrics

The plot shows the trend in number of OSBv2 users over time.
It is periodically updated using the script [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/Documentation/blob/main/scripts/get-user-metrics.py).
Please note that this script can only be run by OSBv2 administrators as it requires access to the user database that non-admin users will not have.
