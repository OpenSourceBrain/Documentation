# Applications

OSBv2 currently includes three applications:

- {ref}`NWB Explorer <osbv2:applications:nwbe>` for interactively visualising and analysing data in the NWB format
- {ref}`NetPyNE <osbv2:applications:netpyne>` for interactive construction and simulation of models
- {ref}`JupyterLab <osbv2:applications:jupyterlab>` as a general purpose Python integrated development environment

All {ref}`workspaces <osbv2:workspaces>` can be opened in any of these applications (though they may not contain appropriate content, e.g. no NWB files).
