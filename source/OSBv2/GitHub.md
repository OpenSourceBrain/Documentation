# Interacting with GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the main sources for code and data on OSBv2.

Any public GitHub repository can be used as the source of an {ref}`OSB repository <osbv2:repositories>`.

The main repository in the {ref}`Guided tour of OSBv2 <osbv2:guidedtour>` has its source on GitHub.

Note for GitHub based repositories and workspaces:

- Currently only **public** GitHub repositories can be used as a source for OSBv2 repositories.
- What is copied to a {ref}`workspace <osbv2:workspaces>` when it is created from a GitHub repository is a **snapshot** of the repository contents, i.e. whatever is committed to the specified branch at that time.
