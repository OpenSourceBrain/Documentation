# NetPyNE

[NetPyNE](http://www.netpyne.org) is a high-level Python interface to NEURON that facilitates the development, parallel simulation and analysis of biological neuronal networks. [NetPyNE-UI](https://github.com/MetaCell/NetPyNE-UI) is a graphical user interface that can be used to control NetPyNE in an interactive 3D environment.

A standalone version of the NetPyNE application can be accessed (without logging in) at http://netpyne.opensourcebrain.org.

To be able to run multiple NetPyNE simulations, create notebooks to analyse the output, and save/share your work, you can open NetPyNE as an {ref}`application <osbv2:applications>` in OSBv2.
