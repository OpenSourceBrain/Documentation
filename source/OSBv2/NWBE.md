An instance of NWB Explorer is hosted on OSBv2.

```

To be able to visualise multiple NWB files, create notebooks to analyse the data they contain, and save/share your work, you can open NWB Explorer as an {ref}`application <osbv2:applications>` in OSBv2. You need to register/log in to do this. 

A **standalone version** of this application can be accessed (without logging in) at http://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org.
