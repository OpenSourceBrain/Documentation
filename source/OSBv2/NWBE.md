# NWB Explorer

NWB Explorer is a web application that can be used by scientists to read, visualise and explore the content of NWB:N 2 files.

A standalone version of this application can be accessed (without logging in) at http://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org.

To be able to visualise multiple NWB files, create notebooks to analyse the data they contain, and save/share your work, you can open NWB Explorer as an {ref}`application <osbv2:applications>` in OSBv2.
