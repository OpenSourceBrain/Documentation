# NWB Explorer

NWB Explorer is a web application that can be used by scientists to read, visualise and explore the content of NWB:N 2 files.

An instance of NWB Explorer is hosted on OSBv2.

```

To be able to visualise multiple NWB files, create notebooks to analyse the data they contain, and save/share your work, you can open NWB Explorer as an {ref}`application <osbv2:applications>` in OSBv2. You need to register/log in to do this. 

### Quick access to NWB Explorer

While NWBE is integrated into OSBv2 and can be used as an {ref}`application <osbv2:applications>` for opening  {ref}`workspaces <osbv2:workspaces>` containing NWB files, a **standalone version** of this application can be accessed (without logging in) at http://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org.

This has links to number of example NWB files, and a URL to a publicly accessible NWB file can be entered to visualize its contents:

### Constructing direct links (URLs) to open NWB files in NWBE

It is possible to construct direct links (URLs) to open NWB files in NWBE for use in documentation.
The format of the URL should be:

```
http://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org?nwbfile=<path to file>
```


(osbv2:applications:nwbe:links:github)=
#### File hosted on GitHub

For files hosted on GitHub, for example, this will be:

```
http://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org?nwbfile=https://github.com/openworm/WormsenseLab_ASH/raw/main/test_data/07-06-25-1.nwb
```

Please note that the URL of the file must be the "raw" URL so that NWBE can download it.
