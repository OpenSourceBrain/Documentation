### A workshop at [Neuroinformatics 2014](http://neuroinformatics2014.org)

**Wednesday 27th August 2014, Leiden, Netherlands**

Neuroscience has traditionally been a discipline where isolated labs have produced their own experimental data and created their own models to interpret their findings. However, it is becoming clear that no one lab can create cell and network models rich enough to address all the relevant biological questions, or to generate and analyse all the data required to inform, constrain, and test these models. The success of the open source software development movement suggests that both model building and data collection/curation would be greatly enhanced by public, collaborative efforts to solve these problems. This workshop highlighted several examples of such efforts taking place in neuroinformatics, and presented open tools and resources that can be instrumental in facilitating further efforts.
