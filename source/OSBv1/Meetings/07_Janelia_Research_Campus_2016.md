#### Collaborative Development of Data-Driven Models of Neural Systems

*September 18 - 21, 2016, Janelia Research Campus, Virginia, USA*

Detailed computational models are critical for elucidating neuronal and network function. 
They enable different levels of description to be linked, a wide range of neurophysiological 
experiments to be interpreted and quantitative predictions to be made. These factors are 
important for understanding large-scale complex systems, like neural circuits; however, more 
extensive use and scaling up of these data driven models pose challenges in ensuring that models 
are scientifically rigorous, as well as accessible and usable by both theoretical and experimental 
researchers alike. This conference will bring together a range of experimentalists, theoreticians 
and neuroinformatics developers with the aim of facilitating a global, open infrastructure for 
collaborative model development in neuroscience.
