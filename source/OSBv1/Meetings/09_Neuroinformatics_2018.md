A workshop at [Neuroinformatics 2018](http://www.neuroinformatics2018.org), Wed 8th August, McGill University, Montréal. This workshop will give an introduction to the background and aims of the Open Source Brain initative, show some of the cortial, cerebellar, hippocampal and other models which have been made available on the repository, and highlight the recent functionality for viewing, analysing and simulating models through the OSB website. There will also be introducations to NeuroML and PyNN, the main standardised formats supported by OSB, and we will demonstrate the options for converting your own models to these formats to make full use of the features of OSB.

The workshop will take place on the morning of the day prior to the main Neuroinformatics meeting.

**Organisers:** Padraig Gleeson & Angus Silver (University College London)
