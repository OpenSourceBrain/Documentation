## How we get the personal information and why we have it

All of the personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for one of the following reasons:

Your data files and source code are only used by you for your work.
For data files and source code stored on other data sources (such as GitHub), please refer to their privacy policies:

- On Open Source Brain v1, logged in users are also able to view your e-mail address. You can disable this in your profile preferences.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are:

- Your consent. You are able to remove your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting us on the above mentioned channels.

## How we store your personal information

The platforms are hosted on Google Cloud infrastructure.
Read more about at the [Google Cloud Privacy Notice](https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice).

Your profile information (Name, username etc.) are necessary to access the platform and are therefore kept as long as you wish.
Any other information, such as your data and source code files are also kept as long as you wish.

Please note that Open Source Brain infrastructure and platforms are dependent on research funding (see {ref}`this FAQ <faq:funding>`).
If funding to keep the platforms running runs out, we will notify all users well in advance to give them sufficient time to download/backup their data.
