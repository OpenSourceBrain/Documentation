# NetPyNE

[NetPyNE](http://www.netpyne.org) is a high-level Python interface to NEURON that facilitates the development, parallel simulation and analysis of biological neuronal networks.

[NetPyNE-UI](https://github.com/MetaCell/NetPyNE-UI) is a graphical user interface that can be used to control NetPyNE in an interactive 3D environment.

An instance of NetPyNE-UI is hosted on OSBv2.

```

To be able to run multiple NetPyNE simulations, create notebooks to analyse the output, and save/share your work, you can open NetPyNE as an {ref}`application <osbv2:applications>` in OSBv2. You need to register/log in to do this.

A **standalone version** of the NetPyNE application can be accessed (without logging in) at http://netpyne.opensourcebrain.org.
