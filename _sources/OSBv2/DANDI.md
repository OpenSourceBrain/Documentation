# Interacting with DANDI Archive

[DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) is one of the main sources for experimental neuroscience data for OSBv2.

An example of a DANDI based repository on OSBv2 can be found here: https://www.v2.opensourcebrain.org/repositories/25.

See https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/DANDIArchiveShowcase for ongoing work to test all of the DANDI datasets for validity against NWB standard, and compatibility with our {ref}`NWB Explorer <osbv2:applications:nwbe>`.
