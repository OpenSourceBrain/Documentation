# Applications

OSBv2 currently includes three applications:

- {ref}`NWB Explorer <osbv2:applications:nwbe>` for interactively visualising and analysing data in the NWB format
- {ref}`NetPyNE <osbv2:applications:netpyne>` for interactive construction and simulation of models
- {ref}`JupyterLab <osbv2:applications:jupyterlab>` as a general purpose Python integrated development environment

All {ref}`workspaces <osbv2:workspaces>` can be opened in any of these applications (though they may not contain appropriate content, e.g. no NWB files to open in NWB Explorer). This allows files to be read, analysed and written across applications.


```{admonition} Want to add **your** application to OSBv2?
The OSBv2 architecture is fundamentally extensible with new applications. If you have a Python or JavaScript based graphical application which you'd like to see added to the platform, please {ref}`get in touch <contact>` to discuss.
